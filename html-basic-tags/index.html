            Damn these comments look different from like, every other programming language.

            Most tags are in pairs <></>
            The opening and closing tag should have the same name

            Some tags are not in pairs and are called empty tags
            Empty tags don't have content

            The head area of your webpage is not considered content.
            The tags within the head area are used by the browser to 
                - Manage some display of the page
                - Give additional documentation to the page
                - Indicate charactersets
                - Help with search engines
                - Etc

        <h1>Basic HTML Tags</h1>
        <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <!-- 
            This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph
            The paragraph tag belongs to the "Block" group of tags
            A "block" group tag places your content on a new line

            You can place all your paragraph text content on one code line,
            however, that would be really dumb lol
            You can use word wrap to fix it, it won't change how it displays on the browser tho
            The content lines in the code won't change how it is on the website
        -->
        <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line in when the content is displayed by your browser.
            The browser does not display your content in the same way it looks in your code.
        </p>
        <p>This is a second paragraph on the browser page. It will start a new line.</p>
