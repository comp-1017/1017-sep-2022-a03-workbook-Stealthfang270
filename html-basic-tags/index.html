            Damn these comments look different from like, every other programming language.

            Most tags are in pairs <></>
            The opening and closing tag should have the same name

            Some tags are not in pairs and are called empty tags
            Empty tags don't have content

            The head area of your webpage is not considered content.
            The tags within the head area are used by the browser to 
                - Manage some display of the page
                - Give additional documentation to the page
                - Indicate charactersets
                - Help with search engines
                - Etc

        <h1>Basic HTML Tags</h1>
        <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <!-- 
            This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph
            The paragraph tag belongs to the "Block" group of tags
            A "block" group tag places your content on a new line

            You can place all your paragraph text content on one code line,
            however, that would be really dumb lol
            You can use word wrap to fix it, it won't change how it displays on the browser tho
            The content lines in the code won't change how it is on the website
        -->
        <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line in when the content is displayed by your browser.
            The browser does not display your content in the same way it looks in your code.
        </p>
        <p>This is a second paragraph on the browser page. It will start a new line.</p>

        <h3>Anchor tag(aka link to another page)</h3>
        <!--
            Anchor tag, often incorrectly called link tag
            One should not use the phrase link tag because there is another thing called a link tag used in the <head> area

            Anchor tag can take you to
            - a different site
            - a different page within this site
            - a different location within this page
            An anchor tag CANNOT
            - Feed your dog
            - Drive you home
            - Do your homework

            parameters:
            href: points to the desired location
            target: optional, default is the same browser display page, "_blank" will open the destination in a new browser tab
        -->
        <a href="http://chihuahuaspin.com" target="_blank">Dog go spin</a>

        <h3>Image tag</h3>
        <!--
            Empty (void) tag
            The image tag does not have content, it is empty

            parameters: scr="relative web site location", alt="printable text if image is not found on file", [title="Tool Tip Text for image"]

            The relative path is from the top of your website
                down/up to the file/page to the file you want to reference

            Down: include all subfolder names and the file name
                sf1/sf2/...../filename.filetype
            Up: use the string to go up a level (subfolder)
                ../../sf1/filename.filetype
